This app is an attempt to make it easier to connect martial arts dojos and studios with interested trainees!

It scrapes (sources TBD) to attach keywords to different schools in the region.

The user then submits information that matches those keywords, to find the ideal dojo!

## Ideas

  - Title: SkipDiagnostic. Diagnosis. HiveMedical.
